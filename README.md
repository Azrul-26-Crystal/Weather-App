# Weather-App
Weather app using Node.js, Express, OpenCage API and OpenMeteo API

* This project focuses on how to manage secrets, learn to integrate third party services into the application, re-enforcing core API fundamentals and getting a grasp on templating.

* Third party integration services that were used are Opencage API and OpenMeteo API to obtain the coordinates of the location given by the user and returns the weather condition in that area.

* The webpage can be rendered using EJS templating which takes a single query and forwards it to the forecast route.

* The goal of this project is to allow user to enter a location which returns the weather condition in that area for the day and/or whole day at each hour
